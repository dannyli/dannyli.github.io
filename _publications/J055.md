collection: publications
permalink: /publication/J055
excerpt: 'A battery management system (BMS) is essential for the safety and longevity of lithium-ion battery (LIB) utilization. With the rapid development of new sensing techniques, artificial intelligence, and the availability of huge amounts of battery operational data, data-driven battery management has attracted ever-widening attention as a promising solution. This review article overviews the recent progress and future trend of data-driven battery management from a multilevel perspective. The widely explored data-driven methods relying on routine measurements of current, voltage, and surface temperature are reviewed first. Within a deeper understanding and at the microscopic level, emerging management strategies with multidimensional battery data assisted by new sensing techniques have been reviewed. Enabled by the fast growth of big data technologies and platforms, the efficient use of battery big data for enhanced battery management is further overviewed. This belongs to the upper and macroscopic levels of the data-driven BMS framework. With this endeavor, we aim to motivate new insights into the future development of next-generation data-driven battery management.'

A battery management system (BMS) is essential for the safety and longevity of lithium-ion battery (LIB) utilization. With the rapid development of new sensing techniques, artificial intelligence, and the availability of huge amounts of battery operational data, data-driven battery management has attracted ever-widening attention as a promising solution. This review article overviews the recent progress and future trend of data-driven battery management from a multilevel perspective. The widely explored data-driven methods relying on routine measurements of current, voltage, and surface temperature are reviewed first. Within a deeper understanding and at the microscopic level, emerging management strategies with multidimensional battery data assisted by new sensing techniques have been reviewed. Enabled by the fast growth of big data technologies and platforms, the efficient use of battery big data for enhanced battery management is further overviewed. This belongs to the upper and macroscopic levels of the data-driven BMS framework. With this endeavor, we aim to motivate new insights into the future development of next-generation data-driven battery management.
