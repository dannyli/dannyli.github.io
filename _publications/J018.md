title: "Dispatch planning of wide-area wind power-energy storage scheme based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition technique"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/J018
excerpt: 'This article addresses the challenging task of developing a procedure for the day-ahead dispatch planning of wind power which emanates from a wide geographical area. Using the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition technique, it is shown that the low-frequency components of the area aggregated wind power account for the largest proportions of the perturbing energy harnessed from the wind. By taking advantage of the slow-varying characteristics of the low-frequency components, accurate forecast of these components is readily obtained and incorporated into the developed dispatch planning procedure. The dispatchability of the wide-area wind generation is facilitated by the buffering actions offered by a centralized power dispatch energy storage system, operating under a proposed power flows control strategy. The efficacy of the developed procedure is illustrated using a pumped hydroelectric system as the dispatch energy storage medium.'

This article addresses the challenging task of developing a procedure for the day-ahead dispatch planning of wind power which emanates from a wide geographical area. Using the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition technique, it is shown that the low-frequency components of the area aggregated wind power account for the largest proportions of the perturbing energy harnessed from the wind. By taking advantage of the slow-varying characteristics of the low-frequency components, accurate forecast of these components is readily obtained and incorporated into the developed dispatch planning procedure. The dispatchability of the wide-area wind generation is facilitated by the buffering actions offered by a centralized power dispatch energy storage system, operating under a proposed power flows control strategy. The efficacy of the developed procedure is illustrated using a pumped hydroelectric system as the dispatch energy storage medium.
