title: "Hybrid physics-based and data-driven prognostic for PEM fuel cells considering voltage recovery"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/J056
excerpt: 'Predicting the degradation behaviors is challenging and essential for prognostics and health management for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, existing methods based on data-driven or model-based methods can face the problem of significant performance inconsistencies in different prediction stages. We investigate the cause and attribute it to the ignorance of the voltage recovery phenomena of PEMFCs observed during the frequent start-stop processes during practical applications. A novel prognostic method is proposed to provide a more comprehensive analysis of PEMFC aging that integrates data-driven and model-based methods. Specifically, a physics-based aging model considering voltage recovery (PA-VR) is first reported as a model-based method to enhance the prediction effect at voltage mutation points. Then, the moving window method with iterative function is used to combine the data-driven method with the PA-VR model, which realizes the online update of model parameters. Finally, the weightings on individual approaches are dynamically determined at different stages throughout the PEMFC lifecycle. The proposed hybrid method achieves an effective improvement in prediction performance by combining the overall degradation trend predicted by the PA-VR model and the local dynamic characteristics predicted by the data-driven method.'

Predicting the degradation behaviors is challenging and essential for prognostics and health management for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, existing methods based on data-driven or model-based methods can face the problem of significant performance inconsistencies in different prediction stages. We investigate the cause and attribute it to the ignorance of the voltage recovery phenomena of PEMFCs observed during the frequent start-stop processes during practical applications. A novel prognostic method is proposed to provide a more comprehensive analysis of PEMFC aging that integrates data-driven and model-based methods. Specifically, a physics-based aging model considering voltage recovery (PA-VR) is first reported as a model-based method to enhance the prediction effect at voltage mutation points. Then, the moving window method with iterative function is used to combine the data-driven method with the PA-VR model, which realizes the online update of model parameters. Finally, the weightings on individual approaches are dynamically determined at different stages throughout the PEMFC lifecycle. The proposed hybrid method achieves an effective improvement in prediction performance by combining the overall degradation trend predicted by the PA-VR model and the local dynamic characteristics predicted by the data-driven method.
