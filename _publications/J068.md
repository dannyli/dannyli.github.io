permalink: /publication/J068
excerpt: 'The capacity underutilization caused by cell inconsistency hinders the efficient utilization of lithium-ion battery packs. This is particularly critical for the second-life battery utilization where high cell inconsistency exists. To address this issue, this article proposes a multiscale reconfiguration control method enabled by an efficient reconfigurable battery topology, aiming to maximize the pack’s capacity utilization. In this regard, a novel four-switch reconfigurable battery topology is proposed, offering the advantages of all-cell flexibility and reasonable complexity. Building upon this, an all-cell equalization method is proposed, combining intramodule current sharing and three forms of intermodule energy distribution to achieve maximum pack capacity utilization. Moreover, real-time reconfiguration ensures effective charge transmission when the pack voltage deviates from the expected threshold. A laboratory-scale prototype of the reconfigurable battery pack is tested, and the experimental results confirm that the proposed design and reconfiguration control can improve pack capacity utilization and efficiency by 10.96% and 14.34%, respectively, without any redundant design. This method provides a feasible solution for grouping and system management of second-life battery systems consisting of highly inconsistent cells.'

The capacity underutilization caused by cell inconsistency hinders the efficient utilization of lithium-ion battery packs. This is particularly critical for the second-life battery utilization where high cell inconsistency exists. To address this issue, this article proposes a multiscale reconfiguration control method enabled by an efficient reconfigurable battery topology, aiming to maximize the pack’s capacity utilization. In this regard, a novel four-switch reconfigurable battery topology is proposed, offering the advantages of all-cell flexibility and reasonable complexity. Building upon this, an all-cell equalization method is proposed, combining intramodule current sharing and three forms of intermodule energy distribution to achieve maximum pack capacity utilization. Moreover, real-time reconfiguration ensures effective charge transmission when the pack voltage deviates from the expected threshold. A laboratory-scale prototype of the reconfigurable battery pack is tested, and the experimental results confirm that the proposed design and reconfiguration control can improve pack capacity utilization and efficiency by 10.96% and 14.34%, respectively, without any redundant design. This method provides a feasible solution for grouping and system management of second-life battery systems consisting of highly inconsistent cells.
