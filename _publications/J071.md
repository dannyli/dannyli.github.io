title: "A unified model for active battery equalization systems"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/J071
excerpt: 'Lithium-ion battery packs demand effective active equalization systems to enhance their usable capacity and lifetime. Despite numerous topologies and control schemes proposed in the literature, conducting quantitative analyses, comprehensive comparisons, and systematic optimization of their performance remains challenging due to the absence of a unified mathematical model at the pack level. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, hypergraph-based approach to establish the first unified model for various active battery equalization systems. This model reveals the intrinsic relationship between battery cells and equalizers by representing them as the vertices and hyperedges of hypergraphs, respectively. With the developed model, we identify the necessary conditions for all equalization systems to achieve balance through controllability analysis, offering valuable insights for selecting the number of equalizers. Moreover, we prove that the battery equalization time is inversely correlated with the second smallest eigenvalue of the hypergraph’s Laplacian matrix of each equalization system. This significantly simplifies the selection and optimized design of equalization systems, obviating the need for extensive experiments or simulations to derive the equalization time. Illustrative results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model and validate our findings.'

Lithium-ion battery packs demand effective active equalization systems to enhance their usable capacity and lifetime. Despite numerous topologies and control schemes proposed in the literature, conducting quantitative analyses, comprehensive comparisons, and systematic optimization of their performance remains challenging due to the absence of a unified mathematical model at the pack level. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, hypergraph-based approach to establish the first unified model for various active battery equalization systems. This model reveals the intrinsic relationship between battery cells and equalizers by representing them as the vertices and hyperedges of hypergraphs, respectively. With the developed model, we identify the necessary conditions for all equalization systems to achieve balance through controllability analysis, offering valuable insights for selecting the number of equalizers. Moreover, we prove that the battery equalization time is inversely correlated with the second smallest eigenvalue of the hypergraph’s Laplacian matrix of each equalization system. This significantly simplifies the selection and optimized design of equalization systems, obviating the need for extensive experiments or simulations to derive the equalization time.
