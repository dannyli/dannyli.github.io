excerpt: 'This article proposes an adaptive state-of-health (SOH) estimation method for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries using machine learning. Practical problems with feature extraction, cell inconsistency, and online implementability are specifically solved using a proposed individualized estimation scheme blending offline model migration with online ensemble learning. First, based on the data of pseudo-open-circuit voltage measured over the battery lifespan, a systematic comparison of different incremental capacity features is conducted to identify a suitable SOH indicator. Next, a pool of candidate models, composed of slope-bias correction (SBC) and radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs), are trained offline. For online operation, the prediction errors due to cell inconsistency in the target new cell are then mitigated by a proposed modified random forest regression (mRFR)-based ensemble learning process with high adaptability. The results show that compared to prevailing methods, the proposed SBC-RBFNN-mRFR-based scheme can achieve considerably improved SOH estimation accuracy (15%) while only a small amount of early-age data and online measurements are needed for practical operation. Furthermore, the applicability of the proposed SBC-RBFNN-mRFR algorithms to real-world operation is validated using measured data from electric vehicles, and it is shown that a 38% improvement in estimation accuracy can be achieved.'

This article proposes an adaptive state-of-health (SOH) estimation method for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries using machine learning. Practical problems with feature extraction, cell inconsistency, and online implementability are specifically solved using a proposed individualized estimation scheme blending offline model migration with online ensemble learning. First, based on the data of pseudo-open-circuit voltage measured over the battery lifespan, a systematic comparison of different incremental capacity features is conducted to identify a suitable SOH indicator. Next, a pool of candidate models, composed of slope-bias correction (SBC) and radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs), are trained offline. For online operation, the prediction errors due to cell inconsistency in the target new cell are then mitigated by a proposed modified random forest regression (mRFR)-based ensemble learning process with high adaptability. The results show that compared to prevailing methods, the proposed SBC-RBFNN-mRFR-based scheme can achieve considerably improved SOH estimation accuracy (15%) while only a small amount of early-age data and online measurements are needed for practical operation. Furthermore, the applicability of the proposed SBC-RBFNN-mRFR algorithms to real-world operation is validated using measured data from electric vehicles, and it is shown that a 38% improvement in estimation accuracy can be achieved.
