permalink: /publication/J020
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a new fast chargingstrategy for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. The approach relies on an experimentally validated high-fidelity model describing battery electrochemical and thermal dynamics that determine the fast charging capability. Such a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamic model can be intractable to compute in real-time if it is fused with the extended Kalman filter or the unscented Kalman filter that is commonly used in the community of battery management. To significantly save computational efforts and achieve rapid convergence, the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF) is selected and tailored to estimate the nonuniform Li-ion battery states. Then, a health- and safety-aware charging protocol is proposed based on successively applied proportional-integral (PI) control actions. The controller regulates charging rates using online battery state information and the imposed constraints, in which each PI control action automatically comes into play when its corresponding constraint is triggered. The proposed physical constraint-triggered PI charging control strategy with the ETKF is evaluated and compared with several prevalent alternatives. It shows that the derived controller can achieve close to the optimal solution in terms of charging time and trajectory, as determined by a nonlinear model predictive controller, but at a drastically reduced computational cost.'

This paper proposes a new fast chargingstrategy for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. The approach relies on an experimentally validated high-fidelity model describing battery electrochemical and thermal dynamics that determine the fast charging capability. Such a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamic model can be intractable to compute in real-time if it is fused with the extended Kalman filter or the unscented Kalman filter that is commonly used in the community of battery management. To significantly save computational efforts and achieve rapid convergence, the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF) is selected and tailored to estimate the nonuniform Li-ion battery states. Then, a health- and safety-aware charging protocol is proposed based on successively applied proportional-integral (PI) control actions. The controller regulates charging rates using online battery state information and the imposed constraints, in which each PI control action automatically comes into play when its corresponding constraint is triggered. The proposed physical constraint-triggered PI charging control strategy with the ETKF is evaluated and compared with several prevalent alternatives. It shows that the derived controller can achieve close to the optimal solution in terms of charging time and trajectory, as determined by a nonlinear model predictive controller, but at a drastically reduced computational cost.
